# QRPT5 Marcus Connors Solo Project For BoredPanda.com
Bored Panda (https://www.boredpanda.com/) is a social networking site that's mission is to: 
> spread good news and highlight top artists from around the world.
I focused my testing on the Home Page Navigation Buttons, Search Bar, and Login/Logout Functionality.
There are seven tests total and two tests that verify if a bug is still present.
These tests can be found on the BoredPandaTests.test.ts file.
The comments given therein will elaborate further upon what the tests do and current issues.

Here is a link to the Jira aspect of this project, showing the entire process from planning, testing, automating, and reporting: https://dmutah.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/MSP/issues/MSP-1

Thank You!
